# NEOVIM INIT
Note: Most stuff now depends on neovim 0.5/ neovim-HEAD.

## Dependencies
- node (due to CoC)
- python3 (probably)
- patched fonts (pref. with nonicons)

## Install
For package management this config uses vim-plug, thus run `:PlugInstall`.
Note that no CoC packages are installed by default, so you will have to install them on demand.

## TODO
- cleanup statusline files (remove dead code, use colorscheme defined colors).
- fix fzf/floating windows
- redo colorscheme in lua.
- fixup neogit
